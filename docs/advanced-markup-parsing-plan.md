# Advanced Markup Parsing with Cheerio for Tana Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing advanced markup parsing using Cheerio to extract and structure web content for the Tana input API.

---

## 1. Setup & Dependencies
- Install Cheerio and supporting libraries (e.g., axios or node-fetch for fetching HTML).
- Ensure TypeScript types are included.

## 2. Core Extraction Logic
- **Fetch HTML:** Utility to fetch and load HTML content from a given URL.
- **Parse with Cheerio:** Use Cheerio to load and traverse the DOM.

## 3. Content Extraction
- **Identify Main Content:**
  - Use heuristics (e.g., look for `<main>`, `<article>`, or largest `<div>` with text).
  - Exclude sidebars, headers, footers, ads, and navs.
- **Structure Extraction:**
  - Traverse main content, building a tree structure:
    - Headings (h1â€“h6) become parent nodes (not included in Tana output, just for structure).
    - Paragraphs, lists, and list items become children.
    - Lists are parent nodes with list items as children.
- **Inline Formatting:**
  - Preserve bold, italics, and links (convert to Tana-compatible formatting).
  - Ensure links are clickable (preserve hrefs).
- **Exclude Unwanted Elements:**
  - Remove all CSS, style tags, and scripts.

## 4. Tana API Formatting
- Map extracted structure to Tana's input API format.
- Implement chunking logic for large pages to respect Tana's API limits.

## 5. Testing & Validation
- Write unit tests for:
  - Main content extraction
  - Structure mapping
  - Formatting preservation
  - Chunking logic
- Test with a variety of real-world web pages.

## 6. Documentation
- Document extraction logic, structure, and configuration options.
- Reference the Tana input API and any limitations.
