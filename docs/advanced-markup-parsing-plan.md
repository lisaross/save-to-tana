# Extract and Structure Web Content Using Content Script DOM Traversal for Tana API

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing advanced markup parsing using content script DOM traversal to extract and structure web content for the Tana input API.

---

## 1. Setup & Dependencies
- Use the browser's native DOM API in content scripts for extraction and restructuring.
- **Use [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) to extract the main content** from web pages.
- No need for Cheerio or server-side HTML parsing libraries.
- **Store Tana API credentials and field IDs in a `.env` file** for local development and testing.
- **Use a centralized `tanaConfig` utility** (with dotenv) to access these variables in both code and tests.

## 2. Core Extraction Logic
- **Extract Main Content:** Use Readability in the content script to identify and extract the main article/content from the page.
- **Access Live DOM:** After extraction, use the DOM API to traverse and restructure the content as needed.

## 3. Content Extraction
- **Identify Main Content:**
  - Use Readability to extract the main content (removes sidebars, headers, footers, ads, and navs).
- **Structure Extraction:**
  - Traverse the extracted content, building a tree structure:
    - Headings (h1â€“h6) become parent nodes (not included in Tana output, just for structure).
    - Paragraphs, lists, and list items become children.
    - Lists are parent nodes with list items as children.
- **Current Output (Working Implementation):**
  - The Tana node is structured as follows:
    - Field nodes (with `type: "field"` and `attributeId`) are added first as children.
    - All extracted content (headings, paragraphs, list items, etc.) are added as plain children with only a `name` property (no `type` or `attributeId`).
    - All content nodes are siblings (flat structure) under the main node.
    - Example:
      ```json
      {
        "name": "Sample Article for Extraction",
        "supertags": [{ "id": "..." }],
        "children": [
          { "type": "field", "attributeId": "...", "children": [{ "name": "..." }] },
          { "name": "Article Title" },
          { "name": "This is the introduction paragraph..." },
          { "name": "Section One" },
          { "name": "First section paragraph..." },
          // ...
        ]
      }
      ```
- **Heading-to-Child Relationship for Tana (Planned/Next Step):**
  - **Goal:** Each heading should become a parent node, and all paragraphs, lists, and other content under that heading (until the next heading of the same or higher level) should become its children.
  - **This nesting should be preserved for subheadings as well, reflecting the outline structure required by the Tana Input API.**
  - **Current implementation does not yet nest content under headings.**
- **Inline Formatting:**
  - Preserve bold, italics, and links (convert to Tana-compatible formatting).
  - Ensure links are clickable (preserve hrefs).
- **Exclude Unwanted Elements:**
  - Remove all CSS, style tags, and scripts.

## 4. Tana API Formatting
- Map extracted structure to Tana's input API format.
- Implement chunking logic for large pages to respect Tana's API limits.
- Use the centralized `tanaConfig` utility to populate required fields and IDs in the payload.

## 5. Testing & Validation
- Write unit tests for:
  - Main content extraction (using Readability)
  - Structure mapping
  - Formatting preservation
  - Chunking logic
  - **Config loading from .env via tanaConfig**
- Test with a variety of real-world web pages.

## 6. Documentation
- Document extraction logic, structure, and configuration options.
- Reference the Tana input API and any limitations.
- Document the use of `.env` and `tanaConfig` for credentials and IDs.
