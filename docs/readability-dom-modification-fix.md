# DOM Modification Bug Fix

## Issue

The extension was inadvertently modifying the webpage when users clicked the "Save to Tana" button. This was causing visual changes to the page content.

## Root Cause

The problem was in `src/utils/extractContentForTana.ts` where Mozilla Readability was being used directly on the live document:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED)
const article = new Readability(doc).parse();
```

Mozilla Readability modifies the DOM it operates on as part of its cleaning process. When passed the live `document` object, it was modifying the actual webpage.

## Solution

Clone the document before passing it to Readability:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE
const docClone = doc.cloneNode(true) as Document;
const article = new Readability(docClone).parse();
```

## Why This Works

- `doc.cloneNode(true)` creates a complete deep copy of the document
- Readability operations happen on the clone, not the original page
- The original webpage remains untouched
- Content extraction still works perfectly

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: Pages no longer modified when using the extension
- ✅ **Maintained**: All content extraction functionality preserved  
- ✅ **Maintained**: Chunking and hierarchical structure extraction still works
- ✅ **Improved**: Better separation of concerns between reading and processing

## Testing

The fix has been tested with the chunking test suite and confirms:
- Content extraction works identically to before
- No DOM modifications occur during extraction
- All 40 chunks are still generated correctly for large content

This was a critical bug fix as extensions should never modify the pages they operate on without explicit user intent.
