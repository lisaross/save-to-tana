# Rate Limiting Fix for Tana API

## Problem

Users were encountering "Token was used too recently" (HTTP 429) errors when saving large content that required chunking. This happened because:

1. The main node creation and first content chunk were sent too close together
2. The 1-second delay between chunks wasn't quite enough
3. No retry logic existed for handling rate limit errors

## Solution Implemented

### ðŸ”§ **Multiple Layers of Rate Limiting**

#### 1. **Delay After Main Node Creation**
```typescript
// Wait 1 second after creating main node before sending content chunks
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
```

#### 2. **Increased Inter-Chunk Delays**
```typescript
// Wait 1.5 seconds between chunks to be extra safe
if (i < payloadChunks.length - 1) {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
}
```

#### 3. **Exponential Backoff Retry Logic**
```typescript
async function sendToTanaApi(payload, apiKey, retryCount = 0) {
  const maxRetries = 3;
  const baseDelay = 2000; // 2 seconds base delay
  
  // If rate limited (429), retry with exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s
  if (response.status === 429 && retryCount < maxRetries) {
    const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    return sendToTanaApi(payload, apiKey, retryCount + 1);
  }
}
```

### âœ… **Results**

- **Robust Error Handling**: Automatic retry for rate limit errors
- **Conservative Timing**: 1.5 second delays between requests
- **Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry strategy that increases delay
- **Better User Experience**: Fewer failures, automatic recovery
- **Detailed Logging**: Clear indication of retry attempts

### ðŸ“Š **Timing Strategy**

| Event | Delay | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| After main node creation | 1.0 second | Ensure API ready for content |
| Between content chunks | 1.5 seconds | Conservative rate limiting |
| Rate limit retry #1 | 2.0 seconds | Exponential backoff start |
| Rate limit retry #2 | 4.0 seconds | Increased backoff |
| Rate limit retry #3 | 8.0 seconds | Maximum backoff |

### ðŸš€ **User Experience Improvements**

- **Automatic Recovery**: Rate limit errors automatically retried
- **Progress Indication**: Users see retry attempts in console
- **Reduced Failures**: Much lower chance of hitting rate limits
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific guidance for rate limit issues

This comprehensive rate limiting strategy should eliminate the "Token was used too recently" errors while maintaining efficient processing of large content chunks.
